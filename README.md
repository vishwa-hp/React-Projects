## Instructions

I've used the [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool to set up our environment. To run the code `cd` into each individual folder and run the following commands:

1. `npm install` will install all the libraries you'll need to get each Daily UI running.

2. `npm start` compiles all of your files and boots up a dev server. Browse to `localhost:3000` to find your application running.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine to run the commands. Head over to the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download the neccessary files to get those installed.
